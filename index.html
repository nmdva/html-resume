<h2>Summary</h2>
My colleagues would know me as an enthusiastic, detailed and result driven type of person.
    Currently, I am looking for new challenges and exploring new opportunities.
    Throughout my work experience, I have always enjoyed the interacting with clients and colleagues, so I decided to take Dutch classes to improve my communication skills.
     As much as I enjoy taking the initiative to work diligently independently, I also enjoy working in a dynamic team.
